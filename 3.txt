Question:

Design a datastore to save monitoring data of a service. Assume the service has 100 APIs and there are 1000 users who are roughly making 1 million requests per day. Some of the sample queries that will be performed on this datastore
 
 - Get the API with maximum average response time across the users.
 - Get the API with maximum average response time for each user.
 - Get error percentage of each API in buckets of 1 hours for 24 hours.

Answer:

To manage the 1 million requests per day we can control the traffic in servers by using load balancing or we can add cache 

The datastore should consist of the following fields:

API name: to identify the API
User ID: to identify the user making the request
Request time: timestamp of the request
Response time: time taken by the API to respond
Error status: whether the request resulted in an error or not

The datastore should be designed to store and retrieve the data efficiently to support the above mentioned queries. One possible way to design the datastore is to use a NoSQL database like MongoDB. 
The database can be organized in the following collections:

1) APIs collection: 

This collection will store the details of each API. It will have the fields,API name,Request count,response time sum,Average response time,Error count and percentage

2) Users collection: 

This collection will store the details of each user.It will have the fields,User Id,Request count,response time sum,Average response time,Error count and percentage

3) Requests collection: 

This collection will store the details of each request. It will have the fields,User ID,Request time,Response time and Error status.


1. To get the API with the maximum average response time across all users, we can use a query like the following:

- To get the API with maximum average response time across the users,we can query the APIs collection and sort the results by average response time in descending order.


SELECT api_id, AVG(response_time) AS avg_response_time
FROM api_table
GROUP BY api_id
ORDER BY avg_response_time DESC
LIMIT 1;

2. To get the API with the maximum average response time for each user, we can use a query like the following:

SELECT user_id, api_id, AVG(response_time) AS avg_response_time
FROM api_table
GROUP BY user_id, api_id
ORDER BY avg_response_time DESC;

3. To get the error percentage of each API in buckets of 1 hour for 24 hours, we can use a query like the following:

SELECT api_id, HOUR(timestamp) AS hour, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN success = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) * 100 AS error_percentage
FROM api_table
GROUP BY api_id, hour;
